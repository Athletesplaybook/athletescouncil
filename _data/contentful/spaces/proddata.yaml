  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "> I grew up jumping fences and climbing trees. It was
    that outdoor lifestyle in the country called ‘country feet.' -- Ruthie Bolton,
    WNBA star, Olympian\n\nRuth Bolton rode the bus from her country home in Mississippi
    eight hours to the campus of Auburn University wondering if she would make the
    basketball squad. Her superstar sister, Mae Ola, had been flown there two years
    earlier on a private jet. \n\n“I was in a state of shock,” Ruth said about the
    paradigm shift she experienced walking onto the Auburn campus. “I felt like my
    high school had not prepared me.”\n\nRuth work hard and made the team and eventually
    set school records. She obtained tutors to help her overcome the academic deficits
    she faced. Then she excelled and made All Academic SEC two years straight.\n\nA
    few years later, Ruth was traveling on her own dime yet again, this time to try
    out for the US Womens National Basketball team. She wasn’t recruited or invited.
    She just felt called to go and compete against more than 100 players who got the
    call that passed her over. Again, she made the team and helped them achieve a
    record-setting 60-0 perfect season. That led to her gold medal in the 1996 Olympics.
    Ruth returned for the 2000 Olympics Women’s Basketball Team and set a record for
    the most 3-pointers in a game, again helping the team win gold. After the Olympics,
    Ruth was recruited to play with the WNBA’s Sacramento Monarchs and became their
    first superstar player. "
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Today, Ruth Bolton’s jersey is retired and she enjoys the
    honor of being inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame. She travels the country
    telling her story of facing adversity on and off the court, which includes dealing
    with domestic violence, and overcoming it all. She traces her internal compass
    and determination back to her roots in the country.\n\n### Country feet\nAt age
    13, little Alice Ruth Bolton became an unlikely champion. Born the 16th child
    of 20 to Reverend Linwood Bolton and his wife, Leola, “Ruthie” was raised in rural
    Mississippi on 10 acres of farm land. She spent much of her childhood doing rigorous
    chores on the farm, attending church where her dad was the Baptist preacher, and
    chasing after her many siblings in a tight-knit family. She wasn’t the tallest,
    fastest or most athletic in her family. But she was the most determined. And she
    would demonstrate that faithful determination to overcome challenges, time and
    time again, throughout her life.\n\n“I grew up jumping fences and climbing trees,”
    Ruth said. “It was that outdoor lifestyle in the country called ‘country feet,’
    when you do whatever you do with shoes or without shoes. That was the foundation
    of everything I did after that.”\n\n### The Challenge\nDay after day, little Ruthie
    had watched her siblings race through fields and leap one particularly tall fence
    in a single bound. She raced with them but always elected to go around that fence.
    It just seemed too tall for her small frame to clear. But one day she decided
    to no longer avoid the challenge. On that day, little Ruthie felt the heart of
    a champion beating inside of her as she landed on the other side of that fence.
    It was that day she believes she became an Olympic champion, a feat she would
    achieve years later against incredible odds.\n\nMore challenges would follow to
    test her will, her athleticism and her faith, which remains the cornerstone of
    her rock-solid determination to overcome every obstacle that life throws her way.
    Today, at age 49, “Mighty Ruthie” proudly responds to the nickname she earned
    from her family and basketball teammates who witnessed her tenacity and undeterred
    determination to succeed. \n"

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "> Growing up in Brooklyn, we played a lot of ball.
    --Lenny Wilkens, Hall of Famer \n\nAs NBA Champion and Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens
    tells stories of his Brooklyn youth, he’s not just talking about basketball. That
    came later. In those early years, the man who would coach more NBA games as a
    head coach than anyone else, played streetball games to sharpen his athletic skills,
    including the famous Stickball where kids like him imagined being their role model,
    Brooklyn Dodger Jackie Robinson.\n\nWilkens says Robinson conducted himself with
    class and confidence, undeterred by the obstacles ahead of him. \n\n“I thought
    to myself, I want to think like that, I want to be like that. Little did I know
    at that time it would lead me to basketball,” he says.\n\n### Unparalled career\n\nWilkens,
    79, has achieved a trendsetting level of greatness in basketball that compares
    to his childhood idol. Wilkens, a 13-time all star, won a championship as a coach
    of the 1979 Seattle SuperSonics. In 1969, just three years after Bill Russell
    broke the color barrier to become the first black coach of the NBA, Wilkens followed
    by becoming a player/coach of the SuperSonics. \n\n“We were so close to training
    camp when the approached me and I thought, what the heck, I had nothing to lose
    I’ll try it. Once I saw I had success at that and I can do it, there’s a whole
    new career waiting there for you to be a coach.”\n\nThe move may have shortened
    his all-star career but it launched a coaching career that resulted in Wilkens
    coaching more games than any other NBA coach in history."
  contentBelowNewsletter: "In 1993 he was named coach of the year. He was elected
    to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a staggering three times (as
    a player, coach and an Olympian). Despite this illustruious career, Wilkens is
    often overlooked in discussions of all time basketball greats. But an ESPN columnist
    pointed out toward the end of Wilkens coaching career, nobody has done more with
    less.\n\n“The only top-50 player Wilkens has coached (except for Bill Walton through
    two injury-plagued half seasons at the beginning of his career) was Lenny Wilkens.
    Wilkens is the all-time coaching wins leader without ever coaching a Hall of Fame
    player in his prime or at his best. It may be the most remarkable record in sports,”
    the column stated.\n\nAll totaled, Wilkens has nearly a half a century of experiences
    that offer an unmatched depth of experience to this generation of rising basketball
    stars.\n\n“Coach is a true inspiration one of my best friends and mentors ever
    who was my first coach in the NBA.” Athletes Playbook CEO and 17-year veteran
    of the NBA James Donaldson said. “He has seen and done it all. When he speaks
    we all listen.”\n\n### The next challenge\n\nWilkens’ diverse life continues to
    evolve. Though he’s unlikely to ever coach again, he doesn’t rule it out. He instead
    has launched yet another career in business and philanthropy. As noted in the
    New York Times, “Wilkens sits on the boards of the Institute of Human Virology,
    a bank in Washington state and his own foundation, which benefits a children's
    health clinic in Seattle.”  It’s all about making an impression on the generations
    coming behind him, just as Jackie Robinson once made on him and other kids from
    the hard streets of Brooklyn. \n\n“I’m all about young people. They’re tomorrow’s
    doctors, lawyers, politicians. They’re our future,” Wilkens said. “Having a bond
    with young athletes, letting them know they can be successful--there’s nothing
    greater than giving back to your community. They were the people that supported
    you.”\n\nAnd one of hs constant messages to up-and-coming young athletes: Dream
    big.\n\n“Nothing wrong with dreaming, but dream big dreams, but expand it. Not
    everybody’s going to have a great, long career. So expand it,” Wilkens says. “One
    thing about sports is it teaches you to make decisions. I don’t care if you are
    playing ping pong, you have to make decisions.”\n\nMaking the right decisions
    on and off the court can make all the difference."

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "CHULA VISTA – It was once the home of the Olympic elite.
    In January 2017, the Olympic Committee and the City of Chula Vista finally completed
    a deal (started in 2014) to transfer one of the world’s best athletic training
    facilities into the control of the city. \nWhen James Donaldson was invited to
    bring his leadership team at the Athletes Playbook to visit the former Olympic
    Training Center in Chula Vista, CA in mid-March, he discovered a 155-acre reserved
    landscape where the world’s best athletes train in relative obscurity protected
    by 24-hour security. The newly named Chula Vista Elite Athlete Training Center
    (CVTC) sits high on a hill overlooking the Lower Otay Lake, a mere 30-minute drive
    southeast of San Diego. \nThe lake is a 137-foot deep fresh water reservoir serving
    southern California. It is controlled by a dam originally built in 1897 and rebuilt
    in 1918. Known for its world class bass fishing, scenic parks and trails, Otay
    Lake had also been the hidden home for the former Olympic Training Center for
    more than two decades. Since 1995, at least 42 medals can be attributed to this
    center, which still accommodates the world’s best training facilities across a
    wide variety of sports:\nArchery\nBeach Volleyball\nBMX \nCanoe/Kayak\nCycling\nField
    Hockey\nRowing\nRugby\nSoccer\nTennis\nTrack & Field\nTriathlon\nCross-training
    abilities for various winter sports\n\n\n"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "The center is open and available to elite athletes from
    across the nation and around the world. Olympians continue to train there along
    with Para Olympians, college athletes and those training for the US national teams.
    \nDonaldson, a 16-year NBA veteran and All Star, was surprised to be greeted at
    the center by former NBA assistant coach Don Casey. Casey was Donaldson’s coach
    during his stint with the Los Angeles Clippers.\nNicole Jones, Director of Visitor
    Relations for Elite Athlete Services, provided Donaldson, Casey and the Athletes
    Playbook team a guided tour of the massive training facility.\n“The center is
    continuing to improve and expand,” Jones said. “Athletes from around the world
    train here. We are one of only four centers like this in the nation.”\nJones said
    the center is interested in building a basketball arena on its property, but those
    aspirations are still in the embryonic stage. For now, world-class athletes outside
    of the major sports of football, basketball and baseball will continue to claim
    this elite training facility as their exclusive home.\n\n*Contact the Chula Vista

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "SAN FRANCISCO – Colin Kaepernick is one of the National
    Football League’s best kept secrets. And that’s a major problem. \n\nWhile sports
    media fan the flames of public discourse as a debate around whether Kaepernick
    should stand, kneel or sit on the sidelines forever, they completely missed the
    extraordinary impact he has had as a positive ambassador for the league. Moreover,
    they have ignored the phenomenally positive response by student athletes and their
    parents nationwide. And that’s a travesty.\n\nOn March 18, Kaepernick wrote a
    $50K check to purchase food, water and supplies for the people of Somalia. He
    started a Go Fund Me page and invited others to follow his lead using the Twitter
    hashtag #LoveArmyForSomalia. Within 48 hours more than $1M was raised and Turkish
    Airlines donated a 60-ton cargo plane to deliver the goods. \n\nKaepernick followed
    that gift with another. He gave $50K to Meals on Wheels following reports that
    President Trump had cut funding to the program from the federal budget. Others
    have followed Kaepernick’s lead. \n\nThere’s a running tally on his website for
    others to follow of every monetary gift Kaepernick gives. He has pledged to give
    $1M since his silent protest generated a shrill national response. He’s doing
    it $100K per month for 10 months. He’s halfway through that timetable.\n\n###
    The Kaepernick Effect\n\nThe positive phenomenon of Kaepernick ongoing charitable
    giving is an inadvertent public relations campaign that has influenced student
    athletes across America since he sat, kneeled and stood up for the issues in which
    he believes. Millions of students, many as young as 11 and 12-years-old, have
    been impacted by what some have called the Kaepernick Effect. \n\nThis effect
    has inspired kids of all races, creeds and color to protest social and racial
    injustices and speak out in support of building a “fair, just and inclusive America,”
    as former President Barack Obama stated on January 10, 2017 in his farewell speech
    to the nation.\n"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Kaepernick set the sports world on fire last year when
    he did what professional athletes have been doing for 50 years. He raised the
    issue of racial injustice by quietly sitting during the pre-game performance of
    the national anthem.\n\n### A tradition of athlete protest\n\nMuhammad Ali arrested
    the nation when he protested the Vietnam War. Hall of Famer Jim Brown held an
    “Ali Summit” in Cleveland in 1967 to support the famed boxer who was banned for
    five years from the sport he dominated. Many of the top athletes in the nation
    showed up in support of Ali. This included legendary athletes like Bill Russell
    and Kareem Abdul Jabbar (who continues to speak out today in support of Kaepernick’s
    position).\n\nDespite the positive message Kaepernick is sending across the nation,
    some NFL executives are incensed by Kaepernick’s particular style of protest.
    They have exercised their power of the purse to punish Kaepernick in a similar
    fashion as the boxing world punished Ali. The message they are sending to Kaepernick
    is one they are sending to all student athletes who admire his courage, passion
    and selfless commitment to uplift others. \n\nThat message pours cold water on
    a hot movement that the NFL could otherwise have leveraged in its favor. Instead,
    executives have chosen to run down a vindictive path. And even President Donald
    Trump joined in with comments that piled on Kaepernick during a campaign rally
    on March 20.\n\nStill, a cursory look today around the National Football League
    reveals a need by many teams for improved talent in the quarterback position.
    There’s no debate that Kaepernick is more capable than many QBs to deliver strong
    value to NFL teams suffering from a lack of quality talent at the position. \n\nLast
    year, he started 11 games with the 49ers, throwing 16 touchdowns with just four
    inceptions. But, today Kaepernick sits idle while Tampa Buccaneers backup QB Mike
    Glennon received a $15M contract from the Chicago Bears and Josh McNown was signed
    by the N.Y. Jets for $6M. Both of those players are deserving of the compensation
    they received for the value they bring to those teams. And Kaepernick is deserving
    too. \n\nThe NFL and the entire sports world should reconsider the messages they
    are sending to student athletes who are actively emulating a positive role model
    in positive ways. Unfortunately, many schools have followed the lead of the NFL
    and punished student athletes for emulating his protests. But Kaepernick and the
    students seeking to draw public attention to important issues are also sending
    a message. \n\nIs there anyone listening?\n"

    says with a wry laugh. “There’s 8, then 4, then 2, then 1…” \n\nOnly not for UW.
    Three desperate UConn shots went up in the final 10 seconds. The last one, shot
    by future NBA player Rip Hamilton, hit nothing but net and crushed the hopes of
    Watts and his the UW basketball team. \n\n“We talk about gamechangers for life,”
    Watts said about Watts Basketball, the coaching business he and his father, former
    Seattle Supersonic Point Guard Donald “Slick” Watts, founded. “That games change
    my life and the lives of everyone in it, winners and losers.” \n"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "### Gamechangers\n\nWatts had spent the season struggling
    with an autoimmune disease that robbed of him of the energy needed to live up
    to the pre-season hype as one of the country’s leading players. In the early season
    he considered walking away all together. \n\n“I was going to quit. I called my
    Mother and said I couldn’t do it. I hurt,” She took him to a doctor who began
    eating and nutrition changes that Watts says candidly, “saved my life.”\n\n“I
    had a tremendous experience as a student athlete,” he says, “It wasn’t always
    peaches and cream. I was dealing with chronic fatigue syndrome and I was dealing
    with it at a time when it wasn’t understood well. it was a tough time in my life,
    but I was at a great place with the University of Washington to go through it.
    I wouldn’t change a thing.” \n\nThe illness stayed with him through his professional
    career. He played overseas and developmental leagues, spent a brief time in NBA
    camps but in the end, couldn’t play to his capability. \n\n\nInstead of giving
    up his dream to be one of the best players to play the game, he shifted his energies
    into business, launching Watts Basketball with his famous father.\n\n“Watts Basketball
    is an extension of my father’s career, and my career... We are about teaching
    the game the right way,” he says. \n\n\n### Off the court and into life\n\nWatts
    knows how different his life was because of his father’s success on the court
    He wants to build a similar opportunity for his own son.\n\nIn addition to basketball
    clinics, individual coaching and summer camps, Watts Basketball works with student
    athletes and their families to map a path to success, be it on the court or off.
    \n\n“We we are teaching shooting or dribbling, we are thinking about life,” he
    says.\n\nWatts is aware of the pressure on kids in sports that can rob “love and
    passion.” Watts Basketball says it starts there. A plan for the future comes next.
    Big dreams, followed with hard work create a path toward future success, both
    on the court and when the end of the game comes. \n\n“We may fail, but we need
    to fail like a toddler,” he says. “Toddler’s fall and everyone laughs and cheers.
    They get up and try again. It’s only later we feel shame.” \n\nFailures and successes
    can be gamechangers. The key, Watts says, is recognizing the opportunities and
    being prepared to pursue them. Having been there before, having felt both the
    thrill and the sudden defeat, Watts knows its his job to instill this confidence
    in others.\n\n“I wants kids to understand,” he said. “There’s a right time and
    right place for everything. We talk about college prep with our kids, but it’s
    really life prep.” "

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "> I told Bill Russell, ‘If you can coach, I can play.’--
    \"Slick\" Watts, NBA player\n\nDonald “Slick” Watts was the ultimate underdog.
    \n\nHailing from rural Mississippi, the undersized point guard from Xavier went
    undrafted. He got an interview with Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who was then the
    coach of the Seattle Supersonics.\n\n“I told Bill Russell, ‘If you can coach,
    I can play.’” Russell sent him a bus ticket to a lengthy tryout, Slick said. “After
    62 guys and three months, I was the last one standing.”\n\nThe underdog went on
    to a six-year career in the NBA. As a longtime member of the Seattle community,
    Slick never stopped urging other underdogs to succeed.\n\nI didn’t experience
    his playing days,” says son Donald Watts Jr. “What I did experience was his dedication
    and his commitment to the community. I got to see the impact he has had on people’s
    lives.”\n\n### Different kind of underdog\n\nDonald’s career started in contrast
    to his father’s. In 1995 he was Washington’s high school consensus state player
    of the year. He then starred at the University of Washington, leading the team
    twice into the final four. Only then did Donald come to identify with his father’s
    underdog status. His pro career was cut short by chronic fatigue syndrome. \n\nHe’d
    play well and earn a job but after the grind of the season began, his body betrayed
    him. He played overseas and in the NBA Development League. “It didn’t turn out
    like I’d have liked it to,” he says, “but it was a great experience.” \n\nOnce
    Donald’s career wound down, he and his father teamed up to launch Watts Basketball.
    \n\n“The brand of Watts Basketball,” Donald said, “is about being an underdog,
    working hard, engaging with people, believing in yourself, and no matter what
    the odds are, sitting down making yourself a plan and attacking that plan with
    all your heart and your spirit and your emotions and doing it in a way that engages
    people around you.”"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Once in business, Donald said his full appreciation for
    the life lessons he learned in basketball flourished, a vision of his future that
    first flourished during his final days in college.\n\n“I wasn’t really prepared
    for college,” he said, “but once I figured it out and got my plan, I realized
    it was made for me.”\n\n### A new image of success\n\nDonald is most proud of
    earning a degree from UW despite early struggles in the classroom. Here he felt,
    at times, like the ultimate underdog.\n\n“There’s a lack of confidence and self-esteem
    in the classroom,” Donald said. “I feel like I was often in situation as a sportsman
    and African-American male where that wasn’t an image we saw of ourselves. So I
    didn’t understand my talents and gifts as it related to academics.”\n\nAll of
    which helps explain the unique mission of Watts Basketball to spur underdogs to
    greater success on and off the court. \n\n“We want to get our young people not
    only about playing college basketball but earning a college degree and setting
    themselves up through sports to be successful in life.”\n\nDonald has learned
    to better manage his disease through acupuncture and healthy eating. He’s even
    known to go back on the court from time to time, as noted in a Seattle Times flashback:
    [Watts Jr.] participated in the pro-am league tournament and scored 45 points
    to in a championship-game victory against a team that included Jamal Crawford,
    Nate Robinson and Will Conroy.\n\n“I still have my game,” Donald said. “I can
    still play ball, but only once a week.”\n\n### Son leads the way\n\nMost of what
    Watts loved about the game of basketball is even more rewarding through business,
    he said, like competition, camaraderie, coaching and touching people’s lives,
    just as his father has tried to do in Seattle for decades. It’s also where the
    son has surpassed even the large footsteps of his father.\n\n“A lot of people
    would say I’m following in my father’s footsteps, but I’d say I’m leading the
    way. When I played basketball I was very much following his footsteps, but now
    in business he’s learning from me.”\n\nAs are hundreds of Seattle area underdogs
    with big dreams of their own."

  faq: "### What is Athletes Playbook?\nAP is a community of former professional athletes
    empowering student athletes, parents and coaches to design their personal playbooks
    (pathways) for success in sports and life. Our venture competes in the mass media
    communications space. We connect with our target audience of millions of student
    athletes, parents and coaches online through our digital platform/apps and offline
    through events and direct benefit programs.\n\n\n### How does Athletes Playbook
    empower student athletes to be successful?\nWe focus on delivering three primary
    benefits:\n\n**Insightful Stories**. \nWe produce profiles and feature stories
    delivered via our media platform and mobile app. We focus on former professional
    and student athletes to showcase success and offer extraordinary insights into
    the lives of real people overcoming real challenges to reach their goals in both
    sports and life. From the perspectives of experienced form pro athletes and subject
    matter experts, we also write about important issues that impact the lives of
    student athletes and former pros and segment them into six main topics:\n- Life\n-
    Education\n- Sports\n- Wellness\n- Wealth\n- Innovation\n\n**Inspirational Events**.
    \nWe offer offline events where student athletes, parents and coaches come into
    direct contact with our former pro athletes across many different types of sports.
    For those who want to meet sports heroes who represent the elite level of achievement
    to which student athletes aspire, the AP events will provide that inspirational
    experience.\n\n**Education and Mentoring Services**. \nEducational tools and assistance
    will be provided through our mentoring and degree completion partners. Our partners
    help us deliver direct services to student athletes navigating the tough terrain
    of competing in both sports and in the classroom to achieve their very best in
    each.\n\n\n### How is Athletes Playbook different from other sports media?\n\nWe
    focus on delivering information that is empowering and beneficial to the former
    pro and student athlete, as well as parents and coaches. We are not an entertainment-focused
    or sports-focused platform. We are people-focused. And the people we focus on
    are athletes on both ends of the spectrum: the former pro and the student athlete.
    Our core business model is the nurturing of the extraordinary trust between former
    pro athletes and student athletes. Former professional athletes enjoy an unparalleled
    relationship with every cohort of student athletes moving up through the pipeline
    of youth and high school sports through the collegiate level. Tens of millions
    of students admire and emulate professional athletes across all sports each year.
    When pro athletes actively engage in communicating with the landscape of student
    athletes, their influence often outweighs so many others. This is a responsibility
    we take very seriously at AP. The trust of our audience is a core consideration
    in everything we do. It is what sets us apart.  \n\n\n### What are the benefits
    of partnering with Athletes Playbook?\nWe have three principal partnerships that
    provide tremendous benefits:\n\n__Brand Partners__. \nAs a startup enterprise,
    we seek to establish up to 35 Founding Brand Partners who will enjoy increasing
    benefits as we grow over the next 18 months. Our goal is to grow exponentially
    in the US and expand across targeted global regions over the next 3-5 years. We
    already have extensive relationships in other countries including deep ties in
    China. Our initial focus is, of course, to establish strong audience growth in
    the US before looking outward. Our brand partners will be presented to our audience
    as an extension of the trusted influential relationship we have with student athletes,
    their coaches and families. In addition to prominent displays on our home page
    and category sections, we offer an AP Marketplace wherein goods and services are
    offered by our brand partners. Offline, our brand partners can connect with our
    audiences directly through our events series. For a one time initial investment,
    our Founding Brand Partners will reap continuing benefits as we grow. To learn
    more, contact Brad Meyers, AP Director of Business Development: bradm@athletesplaybook.com.\n\n__Event
    Partners__. \nAP targets specific regions to establish an initial footprint on
    the ground and touch our audiences. Beginning with Seattle, we are poised to reach
    several select regions across the nation in our first 18 months through our AP
    App Challenge, which will be connected to existing major local events. We are
    currently evaluating prospective partners with existing major events to produce
    our day-long App Challenge, complete with participation from our community of
    former pro athletes. These events will generate strong participation and increase
    media interest.  To learn more, contact Brad Meyers, AP Director of Business Development:
    bradm@athletesplaybook.com.\n\n__Program Partners__. \nAP has a very strong focus
    on empowering student athletes to reach their goals through high achievement in
    education. While we love sports and seek to assist student athletes compete and
    succeed at every level of their sport, our primary focus is to ensure students
    are prepared to compete and succeed at every level of life. Receiving a quality
    education is a fundamental key to opening doors of opportunity in life. We seek
    program partners who can deliver services locally, regionally and nationally in
    two main categories:\n  - Mentoring\n  - Degree Completion\n\nTo learn more, contact
