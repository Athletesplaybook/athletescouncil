  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "SAN FRANCISCO – Colin Kaepernick is one of the National
    Football League’s best kept secrets. And that’s a major problem. \n\nWhile sports
    media fan the flames of public discourse as a debate around whether Kaepernick
    should stand, kneel or sit on the sidelines forever, they completely missed the
    extraordinary impact he has had as a positive ambassador for the league. Moreover,
    they have ignored the phenomenally positive response by student athletes and their
    parents nationwide. And that’s a travesty.\n\nOn March 18, Kaepernick wrote a
    $50K check to purchase food, water and supplies for the people of Somalia. He
    started a Go Fund Me page and invited others to follow his lead using the Twitter
    hashtag #LoveArmyForSomalia. Within 48 hours more than $1M was raised and Turkish
    Airlines donated a 60-ton cargo plane to deliver the goods. \n\nKaepernick followed
    that gift with another. He gave $50K to Meals on Wheels following reports that
    President Trump had cut funding to the program from the federal budget. Others
    have followed Kaepernick’s lead. \n\nThere’s a running tally on his website for
    others to follow of every monetary gift Kaepernick gives. He has pledged to give
    $1M since his silent protest generated a shrill national response. He’s doing
    it $100K per month for 10 months. He’s halfway through that timetable.\n\n###
    The Kaepernick Effect\n\nThe positive phenomenon of Kaepernick ongoing charitable
    giving is an inadvertent public relations campaign that has influenced student
    athletes across America since he sat, kneeled and stood up for the issues in which
    he believes. Millions of students, many as young as 11 and 12-years-old, have
    been impacted by what some have called the Kaepernick Effect. \n\nThis effect
    has inspired kids of all races, creeds and color to protest social and racial
    injustices and speak out in support of building a “fair, just and inclusive America,”
    as former President Barack Obama stated on January 10, 2017 in his farewell speech
    to the nation.\n"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Kaepernick set the sports world on fire last year when
    he did what professional athletes have been doing for 50 years. He raised the
    issue of racial injustice by quietly sitting during the pre-game performance of
    the national anthem.\n\n### A tradition of athlete protest\n\nMuhammad Ali arrested
    the nation when he protested the Vietnam War. Hall of Famer Jim Brown held an
    “Ali Summit” in Cleveland in 1967 to support the famed boxer who was banned for
    five years from the sport he dominated. Many of the top athletes in the nation
    showed up in support of Ali. This included legendary athletes like Bill Russell
    and Kareem Abdul Jabbar (who continues to speak out today in support of Kaepernick’s
    position).\n\nDespite the positive message Kaepernick is sending across the nation,
    some NFL executives are incensed by Kaepernick’s particular style of protest.
    They have exercised their power of the purse to punish Kaepernick in a similar
    fashion as the boxing world punished Ali. The message they are sending to Kaepernick
    is one they are sending to all student athletes who admire his courage, passion
    and selfless commitment to uplift others. \n\nThat message pours cold water on
    a hot movement that the NFL could otherwise have leveraged in its favor. Instead,
    executives have chosen to run down a vindictive path. And even President Donald
    Trump joined in with comments that piled on Kaepernick during a campaign rally
    on March 20.\n\nStill, a cursory look today around the National Football League
    reveals a need by many teams for improved talent in the quarterback position.
    There’s no debate that Kaepernick is more capable than many QBs to deliver strong
    value to NFL teams suffering from a lack of quality talent at the position. \n\nLast
    year, he started 11 games with the 49ers, throwing 16 touchdowns with just four
    inceptions. But, today Kaepernick sits idle while Tampa Buccaneers backup QB Mike
    Glennon received a $15M contract from the Chicago Bears and Josh McNown was signed
    by the N.Y. Jets for $6M. Both of those players are deserving of the compensation
    they received for the value they bring to those teams. And Kaepernick is deserving
    too. \n\nThe NFL and the entire sports world should reconsider the messages they
    are sending to student athletes who are actively emulating a positive role model
    in positive ways. Unfortunately, many schools have followed the lead of the NFL
    and punished student athletes for emulating his protests. But Kaepernick and the
    students seeking to draw public attention to important issues are also sending
    a message. \n\nIs there anyone listening?\n"

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "> I told Bill Russell, ‘If you can coach, I can play.’--
    \"Slick\" Watts, NBA player\n\nDonald “Slick” Watts was the ultimate underdog.
    \n\nHailing from rural Mississippi, the undersized point guard from Xavier went
    undrafted. He got an interview with Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who was then the
    coach of the Seattle Supersonics.\n\n“I told Bill Russell, ‘If you can coach,
    I can play.’” Russell sent him a bus ticket to a lengthy tryout, Slick said. “After
    62 guys and three months, I was the last one standing.”\n\nThe underdog went on
    to a six-year career in the NBA. As a longtime member of the Seattle community,
    Slick never stopped urging other underdogs to succeed.\n\nI didn’t experience
    his playing days,” says son Donald Watts Jr. “What I did experience was his dedication
    and his commitment to the community. I got to see the impact he has had on people’s
    lives.”\n\n### Different kind of underdog\n\nDonald’s career started in contrast
    to his father’s. In 1995 he was Washington’s high school consensus state player
    of the year. He then starred at the University of Washington, leading the team
    twice into the final four. Only then did Donald come to identify with his father’s
    underdog status. His pro career was cut short by chronic fatigue syndrome. \n\nHe’d
    play well and earn a job but after the grind of the season began, his body betrayed
    him. He played overseas and in the NBA Development League. “It didn’t turn out
    like I’d have liked it to,” he says, “but it was a great experience.” \n\nOnce
    Donald’s career wound down, he and his father teamed up to launch Watts Basketball.
    \n\n“The brand of Watts Basketball,” Donald said, “is about being an underdog,
    working hard, engaging with people, believing in yourself, and no matter what
    the odds are, sitting down making yourself a plan and attacking that plan with
    all your heart and your spirit and your emotions and doing it in a way that engages
    people around you.”"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Once in business, Donald said his full appreciation for
    the life lessons he learned in basketball flourished, a vision of his future that
    first flourished during his final days in college.\n\n“I wasn’t really prepared
    for college,” he said, “but once I figured it out and got my plan, I realized
    it was made for me.”\n\n### A new image of success\n\nDonald is most proud of
    earning a degree from UW despite early struggles in the classroom. Here he felt,
    at times, like the ultimate underdog.\n\n“There’s a lack of confidence and self-esteem
    in the classroom,” Donald said. “I feel like I was often in situation as a sportsman
    and African-American male where that wasn’t an image we saw of ourselves. So I
    didn’t understand my talents and gifts as it related to academics.”\n\nAll of
    which helps explain the unique mission of Watts Basketball to spur underdogs to
    greater success on and off the court. \n\n“We want to get our young people not
    only about playing college basketball but earning a college degree and setting
    themselves up through sports to be successful in life.”\n\nDonald has learned
    to better manage his disease through acupuncture and healthy eating. He’s even
    known to go back on the court from time to time, as noted in a Seattle Times flashback:
    [Watts Jr.] participated in the pro-am league tournament and scored 45 points
    to in a championship-game victory against a team that included Jamal Crawford,
    Nate Robinson and Will Conroy.\n\n“I still have my game,” Donald said. “I can
    still play ball, but only once a week.”\n\n### Son leads the way\n\nMost of what
    Watts loved about the game of basketball is even more rewarding through business,
    he said, like competition, camaraderie, coaching and touching people’s lives,
    just as his father has tried to do in Seattle for decades. It’s also where the
    son has surpassed even the large footsteps of his father.\n\n“A lot of people
    would say I’m following in my father’s footsteps, but I’d say I’m leading the
    way. When I played basketball I was very much following his footsteps, but now
    in business he’s learning from me.”\n\nAs are hundreds of Seattle area underdogs
    with big dreams of their own."

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "> Growing up in Brooklyn, we played a lot of ball.
    --Lenny Wilkens, Hall of Famer \n\nAs NBA Champion and Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens
    tells stories of his Brooklyn youth, he’s not just talking about basketball. That
    came later. In those early years, the man who would coach more NBA games as a
    head coach than anyone else, played streetball games to sharpen his athletic skills,
    including the famous Stickball where kids like him imagined being their role model,
    Brooklyn Dodger Jackie Robinson.\n\nWilkens says Robinson conducted himself with
    class and confidence, undeterred by the obstacles ahead of him. \n\n“I thought
    to myself, I want to think like that, I want to be like that. Little did I know
    at that time it would lead me to basketball,” he says.\n\n### Unparalled career\n\nWilkens,
    79, has achieved a trendsetting level of greatness in basketball that compares
    to his childhood idol. Wilkens, a 13-time all star, won a championship as a coach
    of the 1979 Seattle SuperSonics. In 1969, just three years after Bill Russell
    broke the color barrier to become the first black coach of the NBA, Wilkens followed
    by becoming a player/coach of the SuperSonics. \n\n“We were so close to training
    camp when the approached me and I thought, what the heck, I had nothing to lose
    I’ll try it. Once I saw I had success at that and I can do it, there’s a whole
    new career waiting there for you to be a coach.”\n\nThe move may have shortened
    his all-star career but it launched a coaching career that resulted in Wilkens
    coaching more games than any other NBA coach in history."
  contentBelowNewsletter: "In 1993 he was named coach of the year. He was elected
    to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a staggering three times (as
    a player, coach and an Olympian). Despite this illustruious career, Wilkens is
    often overlooked in discussions of all time basketball greats. But an ESPN columnist
    pointed out toward the end of Wilkens coaching career, nobody has done more with
    less.\n\n“The only top-50 player Wilkens has coached (except for Bill Walton through
    two injury-plagued half seasons at the beginning of his career) was Lenny Wilkens.
    Wilkens is the all-time coaching wins leader without ever coaching a Hall of Fame
    player in his prime or at his best. It may be the most remarkable record in sports,”
    the column stated.\n\nAll totaled, Wilkens has nearly a half a century of experiences
    that offer an unmatched depth of experience to this generation of rising basketball
    stars.\n\n“Coach is a true inspiration one of my best friends and mentors ever
    who was my first coach in the NBA.” Athletes Playbook CEO and 17-year veteran
    of the NBA James Donaldson said. “He has seen and done it all. When he speaks
    we all listen.”\n\n### The next challenge\n\nWilkens’ diverse life continues to
    evolve. Though he’s unlikely to ever coach again, he doesn’t rule it out. He instead
    has launched yet another career in business and philanthropy. As noted in the
    New York Times, “Wilkens sits on the boards of the Institute of Human Virology,
    a bank in Washington state and his own foundation, which benefits a children's
    health clinic in Seattle.”  It’s all about making an impression on the generations
    coming behind him, just as Jackie Robinson once made on him and other kids from
    the hard streets of Brooklyn. \n\n“I’m all about young people. They’re tomorrow’s
    doctors, lawyers, politicians. They’re our future,” Wilkens said. “Having a bond
    with young athletes, letting them know they can be successful--there’s nothing
    greater than giving back to your community. They were the people that supported
    you.”\n\nAnd one of hs constant messages to up-and-coming young athletes: Dream
    big.\n\n“Nothing wrong with dreaming, but dream big dreams, but expand it. Not
    everybody’s going to have a great, long career. So expand it,” Wilkens says. “One
    thing about sports is it teaches you to make decisions. I don’t care if you are
    playing ping pong, you have to make decisions.”\n\nMaking the right decisions
    on and off the court can make all the difference."

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "> Our will to compete is the dominant factor in our
    individual and collective success as current and former athletes. --Johnathan
    Holified, Former NFL Running Back\n\nI believe that none of us achieve anything
    without first consciously deciding to compete for it – we never have and never
    will.\n \nIt could be said that I have had an uncommon career because I have chosen
    a less travelled road. Mine was not a likely path: from captain of a winless high
    school football team, to walk-on athlete at a major college, to earning a scholarship,
    to being elected both as university student leader and football team captain,
    to the NFL and the Super Bowl, to civil rights lawyer, to a leader of historic
    and venerable community organizations, to a leader of innovation and economic
    competitiveness organizations.\n\nWhat ties together these experiences is the
    good fortune of being afforded opportunities to grow into leadership roles at
    almost every step along the way. I’ve learned lots of individual, organizational,
    professional and community leadership lessons codified into an enduring message:
    competition is the driving determinant of achievement. And our will to compete
    is the dominant factor in our individual and collective success as current and
    former athletes.\n \n### The Challenge\nMany highly competitive athletes who achieve
    great heights in our respective sport, fail to reach similar heights of success
    in the classroom and satisfaction in our personal, professional and occupational
    lives when our careers are over. The failure of many athletes to convert the winning
    character traits born of athletic competition into the personal qualities that
    favorably position us in academic environments and for life after sports is a
    national tragedy.\n \nIt’s time to disrupt the approach to athlete development.\n
    \n### Breakthrough Opportunity\nWe have an opportunity to provide breakthrough
    leadership in athlete development by nationally advocating for a system of sports
    development around the foundation of competitive spirit conversion. We can lead
    the way to support creation of the first comprehensive system to help athletes
    – from high school to college to professional to post-professional – convert perhaps
    our greatest asset, our competitiveness and will to compete, into academic success
    and lifelong personal, professional and occupational satisfaction."
  contentBelowNewsletter: "### Visionary Advocacy\nCompetitive spirit conversion can
    be a comprehensive, visionary athlete development system, building on incumbent
    athlete development programs that exist in high schools, colleges and professional
    leagues. However, what can distinguish a comprehensive system to foster competitive
    spirit from traditional athlete development programs is an approach that identifies
    and cultivates athletes’ instinctive and demonstrated competitive mettle and helps
    them convert it into a positive force for achievement in the classroom and throughout
    life.\n \nIn other words, generally, athletes make sense of the world through
    competition. We are proficient at recognizing facts and conditions and successfully
    exerting our will to overcome and achieve.\n \nHowever, many athletes fail in
    the conversion of that competitiveness from a necessary trait on the field, court,
    track or diamond into a useful (and necessary) trait in other important areas
    of our lives.\n \nBy helping athletes identify and understand the personal aptitude
    and qualities that distinguish them in their sport and equipping them with the
    tools and skills necessary to convert those assets into the kinds of personal
    attributes that are needed to enjoy a successful academic career and a fruitful,
    satisfying life after sports, a codified system of competitive spirit conversion
    can emerge as a breakthrough national model.\n\n### Competitiveness as Intelligence\nWith
    this bold stroke, together, we could be the first in American sports history to
    recognize that competitiveness is a form of intelligence that should be intentionally
    cultivated and support development of a comprehensive system around converting
    “athletic competitive intelligence” into “academic and life competitive intelligence.”\n
    \nMany would likely agree that competitiveness, when properly focused and developed,
    could be the greatest equalizing asset a person can hold. The willingness to show-up
    for class and life, put in the proverbial “gym work” in every aspect of one’s
    being and succeed regardless of the odds are among the most powerful of personal
    assets and a hallmark of winning athletes and well-adjusted, satisfied and successful
    people.\n \n*Johnathan Holifield is a former NFL runningback (Cincinnati Bengals)

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "> I grew up jumping fences and climbing trees. It was
    that outdoor lifestyle in the country called ‘country feet.' -- Ruthie Bolton,
    WNBA star, Olympian\n\nRuth Bolton rode the bus from her country home in Mississippi
    eight hours to the campus of Auburn University wondering if she would make the
    basketball squad. Her superstar sister, Mae Ola, had been flown there two years
    earlier on a private jet. \n\n“I was in a state of shock,” Ruth said about the
    paradigm shift she experienced walking onto the Auburn campus. “I felt like my
    high school had not prepared me.”\n\nRuth work hard and made the team and eventually
    set school records. She obtained tutors to help her overcome the academic deficits
    she faced. Then she excelled and made All Academic SEC two years straight.\n\nA
    few years later, Ruth was traveling on her own dime yet again, this time to try
    out for the US Womens National Basketball team. She wasn’t recruited or invited.
    She just felt called to go and compete against more than 100 players who got the
    call that passed her over. Again, she made the team and helped them achieve a
    record-setting 60-0 perfect season. That led to her gold medal in the 1996 Olympics.
    Ruth returned for the 2000 Olympics Women’s Basketball Team and set a record for
    the most 3-pointers in a game, again helping the team win gold. After the Olympics,
    Ruth was recruited to play with the WNBA’s Sacramento Monarchs and became their
    first superstar player. "
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Today, Ruth Bolton’s jersey is retired and she enjoys the
    honor of being inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame. She travels the country
    telling her story of facing adversity on and off the court, which includes dealing
    with domestic violence, and overcoming it all. She traces her internal compass
    and determination back to her roots in the country.\n\n### Country feet\nAt age
    13, little Alice Ruth Bolton became an unlikely champion. Born the 16th child
    of 20 to Reverend Linwood Bolton and his wife, Leola, “Ruthie” was raised in rural
    Mississippi on 10 acres of farm land. She spent much of her childhood doing rigorous
    chores on the farm, attending church where her dad was the Baptist preacher, and
    chasing after her many siblings in a tight-knit family. She wasn’t the tallest,
    fastest or most athletic in her family. But she was the most determined. And she
    would demonstrate that faithful determination to overcome challenges, time and
    time again, throughout her life.\n\n“I grew up jumping fences and climbing trees,”
    Ruth said. “It was that outdoor lifestyle in the country called ‘country feet,’
    when you do whatever you do with shoes or without shoes. That was the foundation
    of everything I did after that.”\n\n### The Challenge\nDay after day, little Ruthie
    had watched her siblings race through fields and leap one particularly tall fence
    in a single bound. She raced with them but always elected to go around that fence.
    It just seemed too tall for her small frame to clear. But one day she decided
    to no longer avoid the challenge. On that day, little Ruthie felt the heart of
    a champion beating inside of her as she landed on the other side of that fence.
    It was that day she believes she became an Olympic champion, a feat she would
    achieve years later against incredible odds.\n\nMore challenges would follow to
    test her will, her athleticism and her faith, which remains the cornerstone of
    her rock-solid determination to overcome every obstacle that life throws her way.
    Today, at age 49, “Mighty Ruthie” proudly responds to the nickname she earned
    from her family and basketball teammates who witnessed her tenacity and undeterred
    determination to succeed. \n"
