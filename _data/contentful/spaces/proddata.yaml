  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "SAN FRANCISCO – Colin Kaepernick is one of the National
    Football League’s best kept secrets. And that’s a major problem. \n\nWhile sports
    media fan the flames of public discourse as a debate around whether Kaepernick
    should stand, kneel or sit on the sidelines forever, they completely missed the
    extraordinary impact he has had as a positive ambassador for the league. Moreover,
    they have ignored the phenomenally positive response by student athletes and their
    parents nationwide. And that’s a travesty.\n\nOn March 18, Kaepernick wrote a
    $50K check to purchase food, water and supplies for the people of Somalia. He
    started a Go Fund Me page and invited others to follow his lead using the Twitter
    hashtag #LoveArmyForSomalia. Within 48 hours more than $1M was raised and Turkish
    Airlines donated a 60-ton cargo plane to deliver the goods. \n\nKaepernick followed
    that gift with another. He gave $50K to Meals on Wheels following reports that
    President Trump had cut funding to the program from the federal budget. Others
    have followed Kaepernick’s lead. \n\nThere’s a running tally on his website for
    others to follow of every monetary gift Kaepernick gives. He has pledged to give
    $1M since his silent protest generated a shrill national response. He’s doing
    it $100K per month for 10 months. He’s halfway through that timetable.\n\n###
    The Kaepernick Effect\n\nThe positive phenomenon of Kaepernick ongoing charitable
    giving is an inadvertent public relations campaign that has influenced student
    athletes across America since he sat, kneeled and stood up for the issues in which
    he believes. Millions of students, many as young as 11 and 12-years-old, have
    been impacted by what some have called the Kaepernick Effect. \n\nThis effect
    has inspired kids of all races, creeds and color to protest social and racial
    injustices and speak out in support of building a “fair, just and inclusive America,”
    as former President Barack Obama stated on January 10, 2017 in his farewell speech
    to the nation.\n"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Kaepernick set the sports world on fire last year when
    he did what professional athletes have been doing for 50 years. He raised the
    issue of racial injustice by quietly sitting during the pre-game performance of
    the national anthem.\n\n### A tradition of athlete protest\n\nMuhammad Ali arrested
    the nation when he protested the Vietnam War. Hall of Famer Jim Brown held an
    “Ali Summit” in Cleveland in 1967 to support the famed boxer who was banned for
    five years from the sport he dominated. Many of the top athletes in the nation
    showed up in support of Ali. This included legendary athletes like Bill Russell
    and Kareem Abdul Jabbar (who continues to speak out today in support of Kaepernick’s
    position).\n\nDespite the positive message Kaepernick is sending across the nation,
    some NFL executives are incensed by Kaepernick’s particular style of protest.
    They have exercised their power of the purse to punish Kaepernick in a similar
    fashion as the boxing world punished Ali. The message they are sending to Kaepernick
    is one they are sending to all student athletes who admire his courage, passion
    and selfless commitment to uplift others. \n\nThat message pours cold water on
    a hot movement that the NFL could otherwise have leveraged in its favor. Instead,
    executives have chosen to run down a vindictive path. And even President Donald
    Trump joined in with comments that piled on Kaepernick during a campaign rally
    on March 20.\n\nStill, a cursory look today around the National Football League
    reveals a need by many teams for improved talent in the quarterback position.
    There’s no debate that Kaepernick is more capable than many QBs to deliver strong
    value to NFL teams suffering from a lack of quality talent at the position. \n\nLast
    year, he started 11 games with the 49ers, throwing 16 touchdowns with just four
    inceptions. But, today Kaepernick sits idle while Tampa Buccaneers backup QB Mike
    Glennon received a $15M contract from the Chicago Bears and Josh McNown was signed
    by the N.Y. Jets for $6M. Both of those players are deserving of the compensation
    they received for the value they bring to those teams. And Kaepernick is deserving
    too. \n\nThe NFL and the entire sports world should reconsider the messages they
    are sending to student athletes who are actively emulating a positive role model
    in positive ways. Unfortunately, many schools have followed the lead of the NFL
    and punished student athletes for emulating his protests. But Kaepernick and the
    students seeking to draw public attention to important issues are also sending
    a message. \n\nIs there anyone listening?\n"

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "> Growing up in Brooklyn, we played a lot of ball.
    --Lenny Wilkens, Hall of Famer \n\nAs NBA Champion and Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens
    tells stories of his Brooklyn youth, he’s not just talking about basketball. That
    came later. In those early years, the man who would coach more NBA games as a
    head coach than anyone else, played streetball games to sharpen his athletic skills,
    including the famous Stickball where kids like him imagined being their role model,
    Brooklyn Dodger Jackie Robinson.\n\nWilkens says Robinson conducted himself with
    class and confidence, undeterred by the obstacles ahead of him. \n\n“I thought
    to myself, I want to think like that, I want to be like that. Little did I know
    at that time it would lead me to basketball,” he says.\n\n### Unparalled career\n\nWilkens,
    79, has achieved a trendsetting level of greatness in basketball that compares
    to his childhood idol. Wilkens, a 13-time all star, won a championship as a coach
    of the 1979 Seattle SuperSonics. In 1969, just three years after Bill Russell
    broke the color barrier to become the first black coach of the NBA, Wilkens followed
    by becoming a player/coach of the SuperSonics. \n\n“We were so close to training
    camp when the approached me and I thought, what the heck, I had nothing to lose
    I’ll try it. Once I saw I had success at that and I can do it, there’s a whole
    new career waiting there for you to be a coach.”\n\nThe move may have shortened
    his all-star career but it launched a coaching career that resulted in Wilkens
    coaching more games than any other NBA coach in history."
  contentBelowNewsletter: "In 1993 he was named coach of the year. He was elected
    to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a staggering three times (as
    a player, coach and an Olympian). Despite this illustruious career, Wilkens is
    often overlooked in discussions of all time basketball greats. But an ESPN columnist
    pointed out toward the end of Wilkens coaching career, nobody has done more with
    less.\n\n\n\n“The only top-50 player Wilkens has coached (except for Bill Walton
    through two injury-plagued half seasons at the beginning of his career) was Lenny
    Wilkens. Wilkens is the all-time coaching wins leader without ever coaching a
    Hall of Fame player in his prime or at his best. It may be the most remarkable
    record in sports,” the column stated.\n\n\n\nAll totaled, Wilkens has nearly a
    half a century of experiences that offer an unmatched depth of experience to this
    generation of rising basketball stars.\n\n“Coach is a true inspiration one of
    my best friends and mentors ever who was my first coach in the NBA.” Athletes
    Playbook CEO and 17-year veteran of the NBA James Donaldson said. “He has seen
    and done it all. When he speaks we all listen.”\n\n### The next challenge\n\nWilkens’
    diverse life continues to evolve. Though he’s unlikely to ever coach again, he
    doesn’t rule it out. He instead has launched yet another career in business and
    philanthropy. As noted in the New York Times, “Wilkens sits on the boards of the
    Institute of Human Virology, a bank in Washington state and his own foundation,
    which benefits a children's health clinic in Seattle.”  It’s all about making
    an impression on the generations coming behind him, just as Jackie Robinson once
    made on him and other kids from the hard streets of Brooklyn. \n\n“I’m all about
    young people. They’re tomorrow’s doctors, lawyers, politicians. They’re our future,”
    Wilkens said. “Having a bond with young athletes, letting them know they can be
    successful--there’s nothing greater than giving back to your community. They were
    the people that supported you.”\n\nAnd one of hs constant messages to up-and-coming
    young athletes: Dream big.\n\n“Nothing wrong with dreaming, but dream big dreams,
    but expand it. Not everybody’s going to have a great, long career. So expand it,”
    Wilkens says. “One thing about sports is it teaches you to make decisions. I don’t
    care if you are playing ping pong, you have to make decisions.”\n\nMaking the
    right decisions on and off the court can make all the difference."

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "> I told Bill Russell, ‘If you can coach, I can play.’--
    \"Slick\" Watts, NBA player\n\nDonald “Slick” Watts was the ultimate underdog.
    \n\nHailing from rural Mississippi, the undersized point guard from Xavier went
    undrafted. He got an interview with Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who was then the
    coach of the Seattle Supersonics.\n\n“I told Bill Russell, ‘If you can coach,
    I can play.’” Russell sent him a bus ticket to a lengthy tryout, Slick said. “After
    62 guys and three months, I was the last one standing.”\n\nThe underdog went on
    to a six-year career in the NBA. As a longtime member of the Seattle community,
    Slick never stopped urging other underdogs to succeed.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\"
    height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMWpFV-C4ZI\" frameborder=\"0\"
    allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI didn’t experience his playing days,” says son Donald
    Watts Jr. “What I did experience was his dedication and his commitment to the
    community. I got to see the impact he has had on people’s lives.”\n\n### Different
    kind of underdog\n\nDonald’s career started in contrast to his father’s. In 1995
    he was Washington’s high school consensus state player of the year. He then starred
    at the University of Washington, leading the team twice into the final four. Only
    then did Donald come to identify with his father’s underdog status. His pro career
    was cut short by chronic fatigue syndrome. \n\nHe’d play well and earn a job but
    after the grind of the season began, his body betrayed him. He played overseas
    and in the NBA Development League. “It didn’t turn out like I’d have liked it
    to,” he says, “but it was a great experience.” \n\nOnce Donald’s career wound
    down, he and his father teamed up to launch Watts Basketball. \n\n“The brand of
    Watts Basketball,” Donald said, “is about being an underdog, working hard, engaging
    with people, believing in yourself, and no matter what the odds are, sitting down
    making yourself a plan and attacking that plan with all your heart and your spirit
    and your emotions and doing it in a way that engages people around you.”"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Once in business, Donald said his full appreciation for
    the life lessons he learned in basketball flourished, a vision of his future that
    first flourished during his final days in college.\n\n“I wasn’t really prepared
    for college,” he said, “but once I figured it out and got my plan, I realized
    it was made for me.”\n\n### A new image of success\n\nDonald is most proud of
    earning a degree from UW despite early struggles in the classroom. Here he felt,
    at times, like the ultimate underdog.\n\n“There’s a lack of confidence and self-esteem
    in the classroom,” Donald said. “I feel like I was often in situation as a sportsman
    and African-American male where that wasn’t an image we saw of ourselves. So I
    didn’t understand my talents and gifts as it related to academics.”\n\nAll of
    which helps explain the unique mission of Watts Basketball to spur underdogs to
    greater success on and off the court. \n\n“We want to get our young people not
    only about playing college basketball but earning a college degree and setting
    themselves up through sports to be successful in life.”\n\nDonald has learned
    to better manage his disease through acupuncture and healthy eating. He’s even
    known to go back on the court from time to time, as noted in a Seattle Times flashback:
    [Watts Jr.] participated in the pro-am league tournament and scored 45 points
    to in a championship-game victory against a team that included Jamal Crawford,
    Nate Robinson and Will Conroy.\n\n“I still have my game,” Donald said. “I can
    still play ball, but only once a week.”\n\n### Son leads the way\n\nMost of what
    Watts loved about the game of basketball is even more rewarding through business,
    he said, like competition, camaraderie, coaching and touching people’s lives,
    just as his father has tried to do in Seattle for decades. It’s also where the
    son has surpassed even the large footsteps of his father.\n\n“A lot of people
    would say I’m following in my father’s footsteps, but I’d say I’m leading the
    way. When I played basketball I was very much following his footsteps, but now
    in business he’s learning from me.”\n\nAs are hundreds of Seattle area underdogs
    with big dreams of their own."

    the help of the school principal, Love started a basketball mentoring program
    in 2005 called Locks Lions at PS208 in Harlem to help develop the physical and
    mental skills of the students both on and off the court.\n\n\n“We decided there
    was a good opportunity to start a basketball team but also have a dual academic
    focus with it,” Love said. It was in an after school setting. Kids would come
    at three o’clock and do study tables for an hour-and-a-half and then have basketball
    practice.”\n\nThe seed planted by Love grew into collaboration with other schools
    to develop a basketball league from these unique study sessions. Love says most
    of the 10-12 students who were on that original team are now either seniors in
    high school or college freshmen. Mo was one of Love’s original kids. The students
    continue to remain in touch with one another as well as their coach. Mo benefited

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "CHULA VISTA – It was once the home of the Olympic elite.
    In January 2017, the Olympic Committee and the City of Chula Vista finally completed
    a deal (started in 2014) to transfer one of the world’s best athletic training
    facilities into the control of the city. \n\nWhen James Donaldson was invited
    to bring his leadership team at the Athletes Playbook to visit the former Olympic
    Training Center in Chula Vista, CA in mid-March, he discovered a 155-acre reserved
    landscape where the world’s best athletes train in relative obscurity protected
    by 24-hour security. The newly named Chula Vista Elite Athlete Training Center
    (CVTC) sits high on a hill overlooking the Lower Otay Lake, a mere 30-minute drive
    southeast of San Diego. \n\nThe lake is a 137-foot deep fresh water reservoir
    serving southern California. It is controlled by a dam originally built in 1897
    and rebuilt in 1918. Known for its world class bass fishing, scenic parks and
    trails, Otay Lake had also been the hidden home for the former Olympic Training
    Center for more than two decades. Since 1995, at least 42 medals can be attributed
    to this center, which still accommodates the world’s best training facilities
    across a wide variety of sports:\n- Archery\n- Beach Volleyball\n- BMX \n- Canoe/Kayak\n-
    Cycling\n- Field Hockey\n- Rowing\n- Rugby\n- Soccer\n- Tennis\n- Track & Field\n-
    Triathlon\n- Cross-training abilities for various winter sports\n\n\n"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "The center is open and available to elite athletes from
    across the nation and around the world. Olympians continue to train there along
    with Para Olympians, college athletes and those training for the US national teams.
    \n\nDonaldson, a 16-year NBA veteran and All Star, was surprised to be greeted
    at the center by former NBA assistant coach Don Casey. Casey was Donaldson’s coach
    during his stint with the Los Angeles Clippers.\nNicole Jones, Director of Visitor
    Relations for Elite Athlete Services, provided Donaldson, Casey and the Athletes
    Playbook team a guided tour of the massive training facility.\n\n“The center is
    continuing to improve and expand,” Jones said. “Athletes from around the world
    train here. We are one of only four centers like this in the nation.”\n\nJones
    said the center is interested in building a basketball arena on its property,
    but those aspirations are still in the embryonic stage. For now, world-class athletes
    outside of the major sports of football, basketball and baseball will continue
    to claim this elite training facility as their exclusive home.\n\n*Contact the

    that outdoor lifestyle in the country called ‘country feet.' -- Ruthie Bolton,
    WNBA star, Olympian\n\nRuth Bolton rode the bus from her country home in Mississippi
    eight hours to the campus of Auburn University wondering if she would make the
    basketball squad. Her superstar sister, Mae Ola, had been flown there two years
    earlier on a private jet. \n\n“I was in a state of shock,” Ruth said about the
    paradigm shift she experienced walking onto the Auburn campus. “I felt like my
    high school had not prepared me.”\n\nRuth work hard and made the team and eventually
    set school records. She obtained tutors to help her overcome the academic deficits
    she faced. Then she excelled and made All Academic SEC two years straight.\n\n<iframe
    width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3d5oGQFGnHU\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nA few years later, Ruth was traveling
    on her own dime yet again, this time to try out for the US Womens National Basketball
    team. She wasn’t recruited or invited. She just felt called to go and compete
    against more than 100 players who got the call that passed her over. Again, she
    made the team and helped them achieve a record-setting 60-0 perfect season. That
    led to her gold medal in the 1996 Olympics. Ruth returned for the 2000 Olympics
    Women’s Basketball Team and set a record for the most 3-pointers in a game, again
    helping the team win gold. After the Olympics, Ruth was recruited to play with
    the WNBA’s Sacramento Monarchs and became their first superstar player. "
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Today, Ruth Bolton’s jersey is retired and she enjoys the
    honor of being inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame. She travels the country
    telling her story of facing adversity on and off the court, which includes dealing
    with domestic violence, and overcoming it all. She traces her internal compass
    and determination back to her roots in the country.\n\n### Country feet\nAt age
    13, little Alice Ruth Bolton became an unlikely champion. Born the 16th child
    of 20 to Reverend Linwood Bolton and his wife, Leola, “Ruthie” was raised in rural
    Mississippi on 10 acres of farm land. She spent much of her childhood doing rigorous
    chores on the farm, attending church where her dad was the Baptist preacher, and
    chasing after her many siblings in a tight-knit family. She wasn’t the tallest,
    fastest or most athletic in her family. But she was the most determined. And she
    would demonstrate that faithful determination to overcome challenges, time and
    time again, throughout her life.\n\n“I grew up jumping fences and climbing trees,”
    Ruth said. “It was that outdoor lifestyle in the country called ‘country feet,’
    when you do whatever you do with shoes or without shoes. That was the foundation
    of everything I did after that.”\n\n### The Challenge\nDay after day, little Ruthie
    had watched her siblings race through fields and leap one particularly tall fence
    in a single bound. She raced with them but always elected to go around that fence.
    It just seemed too tall for her small frame to clear. But one day she decided
    to no longer avoid the challenge. On that day, little Ruthie felt the heart of
    a champion beating inside of her as she landed on the other side of that fence.
    It was that day she believes she became an Olympic champion, a feat she would
    achieve years later against incredible odds.\n\nMore challenges would follow to
    test her will, her athleticism and her faith, which remains the cornerstone of
    her rock-solid determination to overcome every obstacle that life throws her way.
    Today, at age 49, “Mighty Ruthie” proudly responds to the nickname she earned
    from her family and basketball teammates who witnessed her tenacity and undeterred
    determination to succeed. \n"

    and a competitive spirit in the classroom. Myron’s story would be very different,
    and maybe less remarkable, if he had turned down the opportunity to travel to
    study abroad at Oxford and instead ran directly into the NFL. That decision to
    study caused his draft stock to plummet. But Myron was preparing for life beyond
    his playing days. \n\nThroughout his journey, Myron listened to the beating passion
    of his heart, which yearned for something beyond sports … a career in medicine
    that would define who he would become when he left the NFL. Myron prepared his

    Every player on your team must know your goal.And every player must know his or

    They bought me food and football gear, took me to camps and drove me where I needed
    to go. They gave me advice about school, girls, and life. My uncles were a major
    part of the team that helped me become successful. \n\nSo my question to you is:

    demographic,” Sports Illustrated reported in February. "
  contentBelowNewsletter: "“It’s ridiculous,” says Unikrn, an online e-sports betting
    company, CEO Rahul Sood of Seattle. “You can go to Madison Square Garden or Mercedes
    Benz theater in Berlin and you’ll see they sell out the arena. When I saw how
    big it grew, I was dumbfounded.” ”\n\nThe future of sports and the future of technology
    is changing before our very eyes.\n\n\n### Betting on the need to bet\n\nUnikrn
    is at the cusp of this great economic shift. Years ago Sood sold his first gaming
    company to HP before he joined Microsoft. Three years ago he left that job to
    launch Unikrn. He said the potential careers for athletes, technologists, entrepreneurs,
    marketers and business graduates are tremendous. \n\n“I’ll give you an example,”
    he says. “The NBA just announced they are doing their own league around e-sports.
    Mark Cuban, one of our investors, is also the first owner to set up his own e-sports
    team. Many universities are starting to offer scholarship around e-sports. There’s
    a good reason for this. The top players who compete, there are smart kids.” \n\n\nSood
    said the attraction of this startup is its unique place in the thriving new market
    of sports technology. As fan of sports and gaming, e-sports provided the ultimate
    thrill and business opportunity he said. He encourages athletes of all backgrounds
    to consider this career path during their education. \n\n“It totally helps if
    you have a sports background, especially when it comes to thinking about sports
    and technology,” he said.\n\n\n### Fitness for the everyday athlete\n\nUnikrn
    is one of many new startup companies within the sports technology sector. Many
    target the everyday athlete or participant in the hopes of connecting them to
    the passion of their sport (or e-sport). \n\nOnce such company based in Vancouver,
    Brittish Columbia is the brainchild of airline pilot, Ursin Camenisch, founder
    and CEO of SportyBuddy, Inc, the company that launched the 5F app. The app is
    like a quai-dating service that seeks to connect people who want to work out with
    others in their area. The name, 5F stands for Find Fit Friends for Free, Camenish
    said. \n\n“It’s Tinder for sporting people. It’s not a dating app, but it is to
    bring people together for sporting events,” he said.\n\nThe app offers meetups
    with more than 100 different sports and four different skill sets. \n\nCamenish
    said his motivation for the business comes from years as a pilot of medical planes.
    Seeing so many people dealing with life or death situations, he realized many
    were related to general lack of fitness and poor health. \n\n“people are suffering
    and it costs a lot of money,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to live a healthier
    life. I want to help people find a healthy lifestyle and build accountability
    to get healthier.”\n\nThe technology of an app makes that accountability and partnership
    for people looking to get more active that much easier, yet another innovation
    at the convergence of sports and technology. \n\nLike Sood, Camenish sees sports
    technology as a market with tremendous growth potential. \n\n“It’s exploding.
    There are a lot of apps out there, but most are based on workouts, especially
    seven-minute workouts, but mine went in a different direction.”\n\nExploding markets
    bring with it all sorts of shifts, from cultural to economic to the way we even
    think about the term “athlete.” As Bob Dylan sang, the times they are a changin.\n\n“The
    median age for a major league baseball fan is 54 years old. So when you think
    about it, every day a MLB fan dies, two e-sports fans are born,” Sood said.  "

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "Tragically, many student athletes focus only on trying
    to get into a school that has a reputation for athletic programs. This critical
    mistake is made even by some of the most gifted student athletes.  Prioritizing
    the choice of which college sports team to play with not only limits degree choices,
    it can also affect career options. \n\nThe fact that so many professional athletes
    end up struggling to make a living is due largely to the misconception that they
    will receive a quality education in a field that suits their interests regardless
    of the college they choose. This isn’t necessarily true. Too often this important
    issue takes a back seat to the hype of Signing Day, when high school recruits
    commit to attending colleges they’ve chosen based on the sports team for which
    they want to play. Unfortunately, the focus on talent recruitment for sports too
    often overshadows the more critical issue of the student athlete’s opportunity
    to receive a quality education. \n\nIt is education that will determine the life
    course of most athletes. The chances of a student athlete being drafted by a professional
    sports team are extremely low. For example, each year, more than one million youth
    play football. And each year, the NFL draft chooses less than 300 new players.
    Think about that pipeline: One million student athletes run into the football
    funnel at one end, in various youth leagues and high schools each year, while
    less than 300 will run out of it onto the professional fields on Sundays. In between,
    there’s college. A simple math equation reveals the fallacy of the sports fantasy:
    More than 99.5% of students playing football (and other sports) will not become
    professional players.\n\n![CEOs infographic](//images.contentful.com/efl6n0ctkspd/3RjM62pk0w8gIU2SWQMYiK/c7cc1d0a4e86f4130fb6b162ccfac7d4/Copy_of_Athletes_as_CEOs_infographic.jpeg)\n\nStill,
    those incredible odds against playing professionally aren’t any cause for an athlete
    to give up their dream. Rather, those numbers strongly suggest there needs to
    be an equal priority placed on the pursuit of a quality college education. Gifted
    high school athletes are given an opportunity to pursue their career goals alongside
    their sports goals. They should consider that on Signing Day."

    to pursue their career goals alongside their sports goals. They should consider
    that on Signing Day.\n\nWith proper planning and assessment, along with hard work
    invested in academic progress, student athletes can succeed not only in sports
    but in life. Alternatively, high school athletes who only focus on their progress
    in sports too often end up going to college majoring in something that they really
    don’t want to do the rest of their life. \nEven for those few who are successfully
    drafted by professional sports teams, these questions remain: \n- What do I do
    when my pro career is over?\n- What do I do if I suffer a career-ending injury?
    \n- What do I do if I don’t make the team or get cut?\n- What do I do if I don’t
    receive a big contract? \n\nOn the flip side, there’s good news. Research shows
    that 95% of Fortune 500 CEOs are former collegiate athletes. And most employers
    believe athletes have the kind of attributes and personal traits they are looking
    for. \n\nThere are so many careers to consider, both inside and outside of sports,
    that student athletes should carefully consider their interests in a major when
    choosing a school, if for no other reason than as a backup plan to a career as
    a professional athlete. Many professional athletes have initially attended community
    college or junior college to get started when their high school academic record
    was less than stellar.  \n\nStudents headed to college should remember that the
    key to a successful education is making sure they choose the right degree field
    for them. It is also critical that the student attend the right school for that
    major; and not every major is taught at every college. If a student places their
    primary focus on getting a quality education, sports will appropriately fit into
    their decision.\n\n* Bob Fulcomer is Vice President of Education for the Heartland

    to being elected both as university student leader and football team captain,
    to the NFL and the Super Bowl, to civil rights lawyer, to a leader of historic
    and venerable community organizations, to a leader of innovation and economic
    competitiveness organizations.\n\nWhat ties together these experiences is the
    good fortune of being afforded opportunities to grow into leadership roles at
    almost every step along the way. I’ve learned lots of individual, organizational,
    professional and community leadership lessons codified into an enduring message:
    competition is the driving determinant of achievement. And our will to compete
    is the dominant factor in our individual and collective success as current and
    former athletes.\n \n### The Challenge\nMany highly competitive athletes who achieve
    great heights in our respective sport, fail to reach similar heights of success
    in the classroom and satisfaction in our personal, professional and occupational
    lives when our careers are over. The failure of many athletes to convert the winning
    character traits born of athletic competition into the personal qualities that
    favorably position us in academic environments and for life after sports is a
    national tragedy.\n \nIt’s time to disrupt the approach to athlete development.\n
    \n### Breakthrough Opportunity\nWe have an opportunity to provide breakthrough
    leadership in athlete development by nationally advocating for a system of sports
    development around the foundation of competitive spirit conversion. We can lead
    the way to support creation of the first comprehensive system to help athletes
    – from high school to college to professional to post-professional – convert perhaps
    our greatest asset, our competitiveness and will to compete, into academic success
    and lifelong personal, professional and occupational satisfaction."
  contentBelowNewsletter: "### Visionary Advocacy\nCompetitive spirit conversion can
    be a comprehensive, visionary athlete development system, building on incumbent
    athlete development programs that exist in high schools, colleges and professional
    leagues. However, what can distinguish a comprehensive system to foster competitive
    spirit from traditional athlete development programs is an approach that identifies
    and cultivates athletes’ instinctive and demonstrated competitive mettle and helps
    them convert it into a positive force for achievement in the classroom and throughout
    life.\n \nIn other words, generally, athletes make sense of the world through
    competition. We are proficient at recognizing facts and conditions and successfully
    exerting our will to overcome and achieve.\n \nHowever, many athletes fail in
    the conversion of that competitiveness from a necessary trait on the field, court,
    track or diamond into a useful (and necessary) trait in other important areas
    of our lives.\n \nBy helping athletes identify and understand the personal aptitude
    and qualities that distinguish them in their sport and equipping them with the
    tools and skills necessary to convert those assets into the kinds of personal
    attributes that are needed to enjoy a successful academic career and a fruitful,
    satisfying life after sports, a codified system of competitive spirit conversion
    can emerge as a breakthrough national model.\n\n### Competitiveness as Intelligence\nWith
    this bold stroke, together, we could be the first in American sports history to
    recognize that competitiveness is a form of intelligence that should be intentionally
    cultivated and support development of a comprehensive system around converting
    “athletic competitive intelligence” into “academic and life competitive intelligence.”\n
    \nMany would likely agree that competitiveness, when properly focused and developed,
    could be the greatest equalizing asset a person can hold. The willingness to show-up
    for class and life, put in the proverbial “gym work” in every aspect of one’s
    being and succeed regardless of the odds are among the most powerful of personal
    assets and a hallmark of winning athletes and well-adjusted, satisfied and successful
    people.\n \n*Johnathan Holifield is a former NFL runningback (Cincinnati Bengals)
    and author of The Future Economy and Inclusive Competitiveness. He is a renowned
    speaker and national consultant on developing inclusive and competitive economic
    strategies, frameworks and systems that empower communities and regions. Twitter:

  contentAboveNewsletterLink: "With less than 30 seconds of the NCAA Basketball Tournament’s
    Sweet 16 game between upstart University of Washington and powerhouse University
    of Connecticut, UW All-Star Donald Watts, Jr. pulled up and drained the most important
    three of his life.\n\nA national audience gasped and cheered as the announcers
    screamed the importance of the call.\n\n“Donald Watts… for the three… got it!”
    the announcer said. “Washington leads for the first time in the game.”\n\nWatts
    had carried the team all year to get to this moment, with a one-point lead and
    the chance to move to the Elite 8. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/siWTD6Ryils\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n“I still think about that at times,”
    Watts says with a wry laugh. “The Sweet 16. But there’s 8, then 4, then 2, then
    1…” \n\nOnly not for UW. Three desperate UConn shots went up in the final 10 seconds.
    The last one, shot by future NBA player Rip Hamilton, hit nothing but net and
    crushed the hopes of Watts and his the UW basketball team. \n\n“We talk about
    gamechangers for life,” Watts said about Watts Basketball, the coaching business
    he and his father, former Seattle Supersonic Point Guard Donald “Slick” Watts,
    founded. “That games change my life and the lives of everyone in it, winners and
    losers.” \n"
  contentBelowNewsletter: "### Gamechangers\n\nWatts had spent the season struggling
    with an autoimmune disease that robbed of him of the energy needed to live up
    to the pre-season hype as one of the country’s leading players. In the early season
    he considered walking away all together. \n\n“I was going to quit. I called my
    Mother and said I couldn’t do it. I hurt,” She took him to a doctor who began
    eating and nutrition changes that Watts says candidly, “saved my life.”\n\n“I
    had a tremendous experience as a student athlete,” he says, “It wasn’t always
    peaches and cream. I was dealing with chronic fatigue syndrome and I was dealing
    with it at a time when it wasn’t understood well. it was a tough time in my life,
    but I was at a great place with the University of Washington to go through it.
    I wouldn’t change a thing.” \n\nThe illness stayed with him through his professional
    career. He played overseas and developmental leagues, spent a brief time in NBA
    camps but in the end, couldn’t play to his capability. \n\n\nInstead of giving
    up his dream to be one of the best players to play the game, he shifted his energies
    into business, launching Watts Basketball with his famous father.\n\n“Watts Basketball
    is an extension of my father’s career, and my career... We are about teaching
    the game the right way,” he says. \n\n\n### Off the court and into life\n\nWatts
    knows how different his life was because of his father’s success on the court
    He wants to build a similar opportunity for his own son.\n\nIn addition to basketball
    clinics, individual coaching and summer camps, Watts Basketball works with student
    athletes and their families to map a path to success, be it on the court or off.
    \n\n“We we are teaching shooting or dribbling, we are thinking about life,” he
    says.\n\nWatts is aware of the pressure on kids in sports that can rob “love and
    passion.” Watts Basketball says it starts there. A plan for the future comes next.
    Big dreams, followed with hard work create a path toward future success, both
    on the court and when the end of the game comes. \n\n“We may fail, but we need
    to fail like a toddler,” he says. “Toddler’s fall and everyone laughs and cheers.
    They get up and try again. It’s only later we feel shame.” \n\nFailures and successes
    can be gamechangers. The key, Watts says, is recognizing the opportunities and
    being prepared to pursue them. Having been there before, having felt both the
    thrill and the sudden defeat, Watts knows its his job to instill this confidence
    in others.\n\n“I wants kids to understand,” he said. “There’s a right time and
    right place for everything. We talk about college prep with our kids, but it’s
    really life prep.” "

    *“I love MMA, Ketchum says. “It tests you in all possible aspects: mentally, physically and emotionally. It's addicting, and you are always learning, always bettering yourself … always being humbled.”*

    Ericka Ketchum stands 5’3” with green eyes and long brunette hair down to her small waist. She says her “walk-around weight ranges from 120lbs. to 125. At age 31, she loves the water and often finds herself relaxing near a body of it or plunged deep within with her scuba gear on. In her “street clothes” Ketchum masks from the world her inner desire: to compete as a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter.

    “I love MMA, Ketchum says. “It tests you in all possible aspects: mentally, physically and emotionally. It's addicting, and you are always learning, always bettering yourself … always being humbled.”

    Growing up in Minnesota, Ketchum enjoyed hunting, fishing and scuba diving. When she was a student at the University of Minnesota majoring in pre-med with a minor in psychology, she developed a life-long love affair with active, healthy living. In her personal quest to be in top physical condition, Ketchum cycled through a number of conditioning routines, including gymnastics, swimming, weight-lifting and kickboxing. She was in the gym four to five times a week when she discovered MMA, just nine months ago, and dove in with a fierce passion. Now, she drives regularly from her town of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho to the Sik Jitsu Fighting Systems gym in Spokane, WA to work with trainer Rick Little, who is preparing Ketchum for her first amateur MMA fight.

    “I heard about an MMA trainer near me, Ketchum said when asked how she got started. “So I went to his gym to check it out. He let me sit in on a pro training session and I was already hooked. He showed me some violent videos of his fighters’ fights. He told me if that didn't scare me away, I am already half way there. I told him I didn’t exactly go there (to his gym) to pet kittens. He laughed and said, ‘that’s good’ and asked what I was looking to accomplish. I said, if I was good enough I would like to compete. He told me I had a good attitude about the whole thing and accepted me into the program.”
  contentBelowNewsletter: "Today, Ketchum is in a constant training routine. She runs
    in the morning and does MMA training and a second session of cardio and strength
    training in the evenings. The exact routine depends on the day. But she’s engaged
    six days a week, and always conscience of her eating habits, which are directed
    by her personal trainer and nutritionist, Dan Parrish. Most of her MMA training
    is primarily with men due to the lack of women in the sport. She expects to do
    battle at a fighting weight of 115lbs, which places her in the “strawweight” classification
    of 10 fight weight divisions.\n\n“I hope to have my first fight soon, Ketchum
    said. “Good matched opponents for women are harder to come by.”\n\n<iframe width=\"640\"
    height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.espn.com/core/video/iframe?id=18350625&endcard=false\"
    allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\nIndeed, MMA is a relatively new
    sport that’s gaining ground across the country. And, as in most sports initially
    designed for men, women have a much tougher time breaking down the barriers. With
    MMA, however, women are welcome and add to the growing popularity of the sport.
    But they are in limited supply, numbering just over 200 notable fighters to date.\n\nThe
    most prominent woman in MMA is Ronda Rousey. She was the first American woman
    to earn an Olympic medal in judo (Bronze), which she won at the 2008 Summer Olympics
    in Beijing. Rousey is the former UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion, as well as
    the last Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Champion. She won 12 consecutive MMA
    fights, six in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), before suffering her
    first loss to Holly Holm in November 2015.\n\nMMA is a full-contact combat sport
    that allows striking and grappling, both standing and on the ground using a variety
    of techniques and skills from other combat sports and martial arts. There are
    three, three minute rounds in amateur fights. Time of rounds in professional battles
    are 5 minutes, but there can be 3 or 5 rounds per fight. Most battles are 3 rounds,
    main events are 5 rounds. \n\nMMA fighting is commonly confused with its professional
    league brand, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Think of MMA as the sport
    of football and the UFC as the NFL league in which professional football is played.
    The UFC has grown significantly over the past decade and was sold in the summer
    of 2016 to WME-IMG for $4B by its former owners, Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta and
    their parent company Zuffa, which purchased the league in 2001 for $2M.  \n"

    When I survey the landscape of former athletes, I am amazed at what they have accomplished, and how athletics has prepared them in unique ways to meet life’s many challenges. Although most student athletes will not play at the professional level in their respective sports, the journey they are on can open doors of opportunity to pursue their life dreams and passions in any industry of interest.

    In the development of Athletes Playbook, I learned that 95% of the Fortune 500 CEOs are former collegiate athletes. That is an astounding testimony of success. It stands as a strong encouragement to student athletes who aspire to play at the professional level that even if they aren’t among the small percentage who make it, they can still be among the extraordinarily high percentage of success stories that emerge from the ranks of the student athletes pursuing their goals in life.

    I am committed to ensuring this platform deepens the trusted relationship between former professional and student athletes. As mentors and role models, former pro athletes have tremendous influence. And Athletes Playbook is a platform wherein they can channel their energy to reach student athletes and make a positive difference in their lives. I am also committed to ensuring former pro athletes connect to channels of economic opportunity and resources needed to successfully pursue their aspirations and goals in life.

    Thank you for playing a role in our effort to grow Athletes Playbook into an important household resource for every student athlete and their family worldwide.

  faq: "### What is Athletes Playbook?\nAP is a community of former professional athletes
    empowering student athletes, parents and coaches to design their personal playbooks
    (pathways) for success in sports and life. Our venture competes in the mass media
    communications space. We connect with our target audience of millions of student
    athletes, parents and coaches online through our digital platform/apps and offline
    through events and direct benefit programs.\n\n\n### How does Athletes Playbook
    empower student athletes to be successful?\nWe focus on delivering three primary
    benefits:\n\n**Insightful Stories**. \nWe produce profiles and feature stories
    delivered via our media platform and mobile app. We focus on former professional
    and student athletes to showcase success and offer extraordinary insights into
    the lives of real people overcoming real challenges to reach their goals in both
    sports and life. From the perspectives of experienced form pro athletes and subject
    matter experts, we also write about important issues that impact the lives of
    student athletes and former pros and segment them into six main topics:\n- Life\n-
    Education\n- Sports\n- Wellness\n- Wealth\n- Innovation\n\n**Inspirational Events**.
    \nWe offer offline events where student athletes, parents and coaches come into
    direct contact with our former pro athletes across many different types of sports.
    For those who want to meet sports heroes who represent the elite level of achievement
    to which student athletes aspire, the AP events will provide that inspirational
    experience.\n\n**Education and Mentoring Services**. \nEducational tools and assistance
    will be provided through our mentoring and degree completion partners. Our partners
    help us deliver direct services to student athletes navigating the tough terrain
    of competing in both sports and in the classroom to achieve their very best in
    each.\n\n\n### How is Athletes Playbook different from other sports media?\n\nWe
    focus on delivering information that is empowering and beneficial to the former
    pro and student athlete, as well as parents and coaches. We are not an entertainment-focused
    or sports-focused platform. We are people-focused. And the people we focus on
    are athletes on both ends of the spectrum: the former pro and the student athlete.
    Our core business model is the nurturing of the extraordinary trust between former
    pro athletes and student athletes. Former professional athletes enjoy an unparalleled
    relationship with every cohort of student athletes moving up through the pipeline
    of youth and high school sports through the collegiate level. Tens of millions
    of students admire and emulate professional athletes across all sports each year.
    When pro athletes actively engage in communicating with the landscape of student
    athletes, their influence often outweighs so many others. This is a responsibility
    we take very seriously at AP. The trust of our audience is a core consideration
    in everything we do. It is what sets us apart.  \n\n\n### What are the benefits
    of partnering with Athletes Playbook?\nWe have three principal partnerships that
    provide tremendous benefits:\n\n__Brand Partners__. \nAs a startup enterprise,
    we seek to establish up to 35 Founding Brand Partners who will enjoy increasing
    benefits as we grow over the next 18 months. Our goal is to grow exponentially
    in the US and expand across targeted global regions over the next 3-5 years. We
    already have extensive relationships in other countries including deep ties in
    China. Our initial focus is, of course, to establish strong audience growth in
    the US before looking outward. Our brand partners will be presented to our audience
    as an extension of the trusted influential relationship we have with student athletes,
    their coaches and families. In addition to prominent displays on our home page
    and category sections, we offer an AP Marketplace wherein goods and services are
    offered by our brand partners. Offline, our brand partners can connect with our
    audiences directly through our events series. For a one time initial investment,
    our Founding Brand Partners will reap continuing benefits as we grow. To learn
    more, contact Brad Meyers, AP Director of Business Development: bradm@athletesplaybook.com.\n\n__Event

    the ground and touch our audiences. Beginning with Seattle, we are poised to reach
    several select regions across the nation in our first 18 months through our AP
    App Challenge, which will be connected to existing major local events. We are
    currently evaluating prospective partners with existing major events to produce
    our day-long App Challenge, complete with participation from our community of
    former pro athletes. These events will generate strong participation and increase
    media interest.  To learn more, contact Brad Meyers, AP Director of Business Development:
