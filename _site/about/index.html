            <p>I am excited to lead a team of extraordinarily talented professionals who are dedicated to showcasing the successes of former professional athletes and student athletes as they experience the journey of pursuing excellence and high achievement in both sports and life.</p>

<p>When I survey the landscape of former athletes, I am amazed at what they have accomplished, and how athletics has prepared them in unique ways to meet life’s many challenges. Although most student athletes will not play at the professional level in their respective sports, the journey they are on can open doors of opportunity to pursue their life dreams and passions in any industry of interest.</p>

<p>In the development of Athletes Playbook, I learned that 95% of the Fortune 500 CEOs are former collegiate athletes. That is an astounding testimony of success. It stands as a strong encouragement to student athletes who aspire to play at the professional level that even if they aren’t among the small percentage who make it, they can still be among the extraordinarily high percentage of success stories that emerge from the ranks of the student athletes pursuing their goals in life.</p>

<p>I am committed to ensuring this platform deepens the trusted relationship between former professional and student athletes. As mentors and role models, former pro athletes have tremendous influence. And Athletes Playbook is a platform wherein they can channel their energy to reach student athletes and make a positive difference in their lives. I am also committed to ensuring former pro athletes connect to channels of economic opportunity and resources needed to successfully pursue their aspirations and goals in life.</p>

<p>Thank you for playing a role in our effort to grow Athletes Playbook into an important household resource for every student athlete and their family worldwide.</p>
