  <p>Our will to compete is the dominant factor in our individual and collective success as current and former athletes. –Johnathan Holified, Former NFL Running Back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that none of us achieve anything without first consciously deciding to compete for it – we never have and never will.</p>

<p>It could be said that I have had an uncommon career because I have chosen a less travelled road. Mine was not a likely path: from captain of a winless high school football team, to walk-on athlete at a major college, to earning a scholarship, to being elected both as university student leader and football team captain, to the NFL and the Super Bowl, to civil rights lawyer, to a leader of historic and venerable community organizations, to a leader of innovation and economic competitiveness organizations.</p>

<p>What ties together these experiences is the good fortune of being afforded opportunities to grow into leadership roles at almost every step along the way. I’ve learned lots of individual, organizational, professional and community leadership lessons codified into an enduring message: competition is the driving determinant of achievement. And our will to compete is the dominant factor in our individual and collective success as current and former athletes.</p>

<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>
<p>Many highly competitive athletes who achieve great heights in our respective sport, fail to reach similar heights of success in the classroom and satisfaction in our personal, professional and occupational lives when our careers are over. The failure of many athletes to convert the winning character traits born of athletic competition into the personal qualities that favorably position us in academic environments and for life after sports is a national tragedy.</p>

<p>It’s time to disrupt the approach to athlete development.</p>

<h3 id="breakthrough-opportunity">Breakthrough Opportunity</h3>
<p>We have an opportunity to provide breakthrough leadership in athlete development by nationally advocating for a system of sports development around the foundation of competitive spirit conversion. We can lead the way to support creation of the first comprehensive system to help athletes – from high school to college to professional to post-professional – convert perhaps our greatest asset, our competitiveness and will to compete, into academic success and lifelong personal, professional and occupational satisfaction.</p>

                <h3 id="visionary-advocacy">Visionary Advocacy</h3>
<p>Competitive spirit conversion can be a comprehensive, visionary athlete development system, building on incumbent athlete development programs that exist in high schools, colleges and professional leagues. However, what can distinguish a comprehensive system to foster competitive spirit from traditional athlete development programs is an approach that identifies and cultivates athletes’ instinctive and demonstrated competitive mettle and helps them convert it into a positive force for achievement in the classroom and throughout life.</p>

<p>In other words, generally, athletes make sense of the world through competition. We are proficient at recognizing facts and conditions and successfully exerting our will to overcome and achieve.</p>

<p>However, many athletes fail in the conversion of that competitiveness from a necessary trait on the field, court, track or diamond into a useful (and necessary) trait in other important areas of our lives.</p>

<p>By helping athletes identify and understand the personal aptitude and qualities that distinguish them in their sport and equipping them with the tools and skills necessary to convert those assets into the kinds of personal attributes that are needed to enjoy a successful academic career and a fruitful, satisfying life after sports, a codified system of competitive spirit conversion can emerge as a breakthrough national model.</p>

<h3 id="competitiveness-as-intelligence">Competitiveness as Intelligence</h3>
<p>With this bold stroke, together, we could be the first in American sports history to recognize that competitiveness is a form of intelligence that should be intentionally cultivated and support development of a comprehensive system around converting “athletic competitive intelligence” into “academic and life competitive intelligence.”</p>

<p>Many would likely agree that competitiveness, when properly focused and developed, could be the greatest equalizing asset a person can hold. The willingness to show-up for class and life, put in the proverbial “gym work” in every aspect of one’s being and succeed regardless of the odds are among the most powerful of personal assets and a hallmark of winning athletes and well-adjusted, satisfied and successful people.</p>
