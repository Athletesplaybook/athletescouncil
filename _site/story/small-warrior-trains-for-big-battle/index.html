<p>Ericka Ketchum stands 5’3” with green eyes and long brunette hair down to her small waist. She says her “walk-around weight ranges from 120lbs. to 125. At age 31, she loves the water and often finds herself relaxing near a body of it or plunged deep within with her scuba gear on. In her “street clothes” Ketchum masks from the world her inner desire: to compete as a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter.</p>

<p>“I love MMA, Ketchum says. “It tests you in all possible aspects: mentally, physically and emotionally. It’s addicting, and you are always learning, always bettering yourself … always being humbled.”</p>

<p>Growing up in Minnesota, Ketchum enjoyed hunting, fishing and scuba diving. When she was a student at the University of Minnesota majoring in pre-med with a minor in psychology, she developed a life-long love affair with active, healthy living. In her personal quest to be in top physical condition, Ketchum cycled through a number of conditioning routines, including gymnastics, swimming, weight-lifting and kickboxing. She was in the gym four to five times a week when she discovered MMA, just nine months ago, and dove in with a fierce passion. Now, she drives regularly from her town of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho to the Sik Jitsu Fighting Systems gym in Spokane, WA to work with trainer Rick Little, who is preparing Ketchum for her first amateur MMA fight.</p>

<p>“I heard about an MMA trainer near me, Ketchum said when asked how she got started. “So I went to his gym to check it out. He let me sit in on a pro training session and I was already hooked. He showed me some violent videos of his fighters’ fights. He told me if that didn’t scare me away, I am already half way there. I told him I didn’t exactly go there (to his gym) to pet kittens. He laughed and said, ‘that’s good’ and asked what I was looking to accomplish. I said, if I was good enough I would like to compete. He told me I had a good attitude about the whole thing and accepted me into the program.”</p>

                <p>Today, Ketchum is in a constant training routine. She runs in the morning and does MMA training and a second session of cardio and strength training in the evenings. The exact routine depends on the day. But she’s engaged six days a week, and always conscience of her eating habits, which are directed by her personal trainer and nutritionist, Dan Parrish. Most of her MMA training is primarily with men due to the lack of women in the sport. She expects to do battle at a fighting weight of 115lbs, which places her in the “strawweight” classification of 10 fight weight divisions.</p>

<p>“I hope to have my first fight soon, Ketchum said. “Good matched opponents for women are harder to come by.”</p>

<p>Indeed, MMA is a relatively new sport that’s gaining ground across the country. And, as in most sports initially designed for men, women have a much tougher time breaking down the barriers. With MMA, however, women are welcome and add to the growing popularity of the sport. But they are in limited supply, numbering just over 200 notable fighters to date.</p>

<p>The most prominent woman in MMA is Ronda Rousey. She was the first American woman to earn an Olympic medal in judo (Bronze), which she won at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Rousey is the former UFC Women’s Bantamweight Champion, as well as the last Strikeforce Women’s Bantamweight Champion. She won 12 consecutive MMA fights, six in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), before suffering her first loss to Holly Holm in November 2015.</p>

<p>MMA is a full-contact combat sport that allows striking and grappling, both standing and on the ground using a variety of techniques and skills from other combat sports and martial arts. There are three, three minute rounds in amateur fights. Time of rounds in professional battles are 5 minutes, but there can be 3 or 5 rounds per fight. Most battles are 3 rounds, main events are 5 rounds.</p>

<p>MMA fighting is commonly confused with its professional league brand, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Think of MMA as the sport of football and the UFC as the NFL league in which professional football is played. The UFC has grown significantly over the past decade and was sold in the summer of 2016 to WME-IMG for $4B by its former owners, Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta and their parent company Zuffa, which purchased the league in 2001 for $2M.</p>
