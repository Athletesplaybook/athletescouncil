  <p>I grew up jumping fences and climbing trees. It was that outdoor lifestyle in the country called ‘country feet.’ – Ruthie Bolton, WNBA star, Olympian</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ruth Bolton rode the bus from her country home in Mississippi eight hours to the campus of Auburn University wondering if she would make the basketball squad. Her superstar sister, Mae Ola, had been flown there two years earlier on a private jet.</p>

<p>“I was in a state of shock,” Ruth said about the paradigm shift she experienced walking onto the Auburn campus. “I felt like my high school had not prepared me.”</p>

<p>Ruth work hard and made the team and eventually set school records. She obtained tutors to help her overcome the academic deficits she faced. Then she excelled and made All Academic SEC two years straight.</p>

<p>A few years later, Ruth was traveling on her own dime yet again, this time to try out for the US Womens National Basketball team. She wasn’t recruited or invited. She just felt called to go and compete against more than 100 players who got the call that passed her over. Again, she made the team and helped them achieve a record-setting 60-0 perfect season. That led to her gold medal in the 1996 Olympics. Ruth returned for the 2000 Olympics Women’s Basketball Team and set a record for the most 3-pointers in a game, again helping the team win gold. After the Olympics, Ruth was recruited to play with the WNBA’s Sacramento Monarchs and became their first superstar player.</p>

                <p>Today, Ruth Bolton’s jersey is retired and she enjoys the honor of being inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame. She travels the country telling her story of facing adversity on and off the court, which includes dealing with domestic violence, and overcoming it all. She traces her internal compass and determination back to her roots in the country.</p>

<h3 id="country-feet">Country feet</h3>
<p>At age 13, little Alice Ruth Bolton became an unlikely champion. Born the 16th child of 20 to Reverend Linwood Bolton and his wife, Leola, “Ruthie” was raised in rural Mississippi on 10 acres of farm land. She spent much of her childhood doing rigorous chores on the farm, attending church where her dad was the Baptist preacher, and chasing after her many siblings in a tight-knit family. She wasn’t the tallest, fastest or most athletic in her family. But she was the most determined. And she would demonstrate that faithful determination to overcome challenges, time and time again, throughout her life.</p>

<p>“I grew up jumping fences and climbing trees,” Ruth said. “It was that outdoor lifestyle in the country called ‘country feet,’ when you do whatever you do with shoes or without shoes. That was the foundation of everything I did after that.”</p>

<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>
<p>Day after day, little Ruthie had watched her siblings race through fields and leap one particularly tall fence in a single bound. She raced with them but always elected to go around that fence. It just seemed too tall for her small frame to clear. But one day she decided to no longer avoid the challenge. On that day, little Ruthie felt the heart of a champion beating inside of her as she landed on the other side of that fence. It was that day she believes she became an Olympic champion, a feat she would achieve years later against incredible odds.</p>

<p>More challenges would follow to test her will, her athleticism and her faith, which remains the cornerstone of her rock-solid determination to overcome every obstacle that life throws her way. Today, at age 49, “Mighty Ruthie” proudly responds to the nickname she earned from her family and basketball teammates who witnessed her tenacity and undeterred determination to succeed.</p>
