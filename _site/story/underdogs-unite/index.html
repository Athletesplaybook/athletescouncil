                <p class="big center-text subtitle"><strong>Lenny Wilkins</strong> says</p>
                <p class="big"><blockquote>
  <p>I told Bill Russell, ‘If you can coach, I can play.’– “Slick” Watts, NBA player</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Donald “Slick” Watts was the ultimate underdog.</p>

<p>Hailing from rural Mississippi, the undersized point guard from Xavier went undrafted. He got an interview with Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who was then the coach of the Seattle Supersonics.</p>

<p>“I told Bill Russell, ‘If you can coach, I can play.’” Russell sent him a bus ticket to a lengthy tryout, Slick said. “After 62 guys and three months, I was the last one standing.”</p>

<p>The underdog went on to a six-year career in the NBA. As a longtime member of the Seattle community, Slick never stopped urging other underdogs to succeed.</p>

<p>I didn’t experience his playing days,” says son Donald Watts Jr. “What I did experience was his dedication and his commitment to the community. I got to see the impact he has had on people’s lives.”</p>

<h3 id="different-kind-of-underdog">Different kind of underdog</h3>

<p>Donald’s career started in contrast to his father’s. In 1995 he was Washington’s high school consensus state player of the year. He then starred at the University of Washington, leading the team twice into the final four. Only then did Donald come to identify with his father’s underdog status. His pro career was cut short by chronic fatigue syndrome.</p>

<p>He’d play well and earn a job but after the grind of the season began, his body betrayed him. He played overseas and in the NBA Development League. “It didn’t turn out like I’d have liked it to,” he says, “but it was a great experience.”</p>

<p>Once Donald’s career wound down, he and his father teamed up to launch Watts Basketball.</p>

<p>“The brand of Watts Basketball,” Donald said, “is about being an underdog, working hard, engaging with people, believing in yourself, and no matter what the odds are, sitting down making yourself a plan and attacking that plan with all your heart and your spirit and your emotions and doing it in a way that engages people around you.”</p>

                <p>Once in business, Donald said his full appreciation for the life lessons he learned in basketball flourished, a vision of his future that first flourished during his final days in college.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t really prepared for college,” he said, “but once I figured it out and got my plan, I realized it was made for me.”</p>

<h3 id="a-new-image-of-success">A new image of success</h3>

<p>Donald is most proud of earning a degree from UW despite early struggles in the classroom. Here he felt, at times, like the ultimate underdog.</p>

<p>“There’s a lack of confidence and self-esteem in the classroom,” Donald said. “I feel like I was often in situation as a sportsman and African-American male where that wasn’t an image we saw of ourselves. So I didn’t understand my talents and gifts as it related to academics.”</p>

<p>All of which helps explain the unique mission of Watts Basketball to spur underdogs to greater success on and off the court.</p>

<p>“We want to get our young people not only about playing college basketball but earning a college degree and setting themselves up through sports to be successful in life.”</p>

<p>Donald has learned to better manage his disease through acupuncture and healthy eating. He’s even known to go back on the court from time to time, as noted in a Seattle Times flashback: [Watts Jr.] participated in the pro-am league tournament and scored 45 points to in a championship-game victory against a team that included Jamal Crawford, Nate Robinson and Will Conroy.</p>

<p>“I still have my game,” Donald said. “I can still play ball, but only once a week.”</p>

<h3 id="son-leads-the-way">Son leads the way</h3>

<p>Most of what Watts loved about the game of basketball is even more rewarding through business, he said, like competition, camaraderie, coaching and touching people’s lives, just as his father has tried to do in Seattle for decades. It’s also where the son has surpassed even the large footsteps of his father.</p>

<p>“A lot of people would say I’m following in my father’s footsteps, but I’d say I’m leading the way. When I played basketball I was very much following his footsteps, but now in business he’s learning from me.”</p>

<p>As are hundreds of Seattle area underdogs with big dreams of their own.</p>
